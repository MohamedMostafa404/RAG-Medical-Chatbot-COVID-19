Viruses are unique among these\\nfive types of infectious organisms in that they can\\nmanipulate the host-cell machinery in a unique way and\\ncontinuously evolve to survive and prosper in all species\\n[1].\\nCOVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus\\ncalled SARS-CoV-2. WHO first learned of this new virus on\\n31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases\\nof ‘viral pneumonia’ in Wuhan, People’s Republic of China\\n[2].\\nSince December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease had\\nrapidly spread throughout China, leading to a global\\noutbreak, and causing considerable public health concern.\\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) announced the\\noutbreak of COVID-19 as a global public health emergency\\non 30 January 2020. In India, the first case of COVID-19\\nwas reported on January 27, 2020, in Kerala district. Since\\nthen, there is a wide variation in the reporting of cases\\nacross the country. The case reporting is based on the\\nSARS-CoV-2 \\nantigen \\ntesting \\nby \\nReal-Time \\nReverse\\nTranscription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) or by\\nRapid Antigen Test (RAT) [3].\\nCoronavirus (CoV) is clustered under the viral family\\ngroup that causes disease in mammals and birds. A\\npandemic novel coronavirus was named as ‘‘Corona Virus\\nDisease 2019’’ (2019-nCoV) by World Health Organization\\n(WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland. As its RNA pattern is closer\\nto SARS, the 2019 Coronavirus is renamed as SARSCoV- 2\\npandemic. It belongs to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae\\ninside the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and the\\nrealm Riboviria [4]. A two-dimensional view of Corona\\nbeneath a transmission electron microscopy reveals a\\ncharacteristic look of ‘‘paying homage to a crown’’ around\\nthe virions.

The first such\\ninstance was in 2002–2003 when a new coronavirus of\\nthe β genera and with origin in bats crossed over to\\nhumans via the intermediary host of palm civet cats in\\nthe Guangdong province of China. This virus, designated\\nas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\\naffected 8422 people mostly in China and Hong Kong and\\ncaused 916 deaths (mortality rate 11%) before being\\ncontained. Almost a decade later in 2012, the Middle East\\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), also of\\nbat origin, emerged in Saudi Arabia with dromedary\\ncamels as the intermediate host and affected 2494 people\\nand caused 858 deaths (fatality rate 34%) [5].\\nSYMPTOMS\\nA wide range of symptoms are found in COVID-19\\npatients, ranging from mild/moderate to severe, rapidly\\nprogressive, and fulminant disease. Symptoms of\\nCOVID-19 are non-specific and disease presentation can\\nrange \\nfrom \\nasymptomatic \\nto \\nsevere \\npneumonia.\\nIncidence of asymptomatic cases ranges from 1.6% to\\n51.7% and these people do not present typical clinical\\nsymptoms or signs and do not present apparent\\nabnormalities in lung computed tomography. The most\\ncommon symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough,\\nmyalgia, or fatigue and atypical symptoms include\\nsputum, headache, haemoptysis, vomiting, and diarrhoea.\\nSome patients may present with sore throat, rhinorrhoea,\\nheadache, and confusion a few days before the onset of\\nfever, indicating that fever is a critical symptom, but not\\nthe initial manifestation of infection. Furthermore, some\\npatients experience loss of smell (hyposmia) or taste\\n(hypogeusia), which are now being considered early\\nwarning signs and indications for self-isolation [6].\\nThe most common symptoms of COVID-19 are\\n•\\nFever.\\n•\\nDry cough.\\n•\\nFatigue.\\nOther symptoms that are less common and may affect\\nsome patients include\\n•\\nLoss of taste or smell.\\n•\\nNasal congestion.\\n•\\nConjunctivitis (also known as red eyes).\\n•\\nSore throat.\\n•\\nHeadache.\\n•\\nMuscle or joint pain.\\n•\\nDifferent types of skin rash.\\n•\\nNausea or vomiting.\\n•\\nDiarrhea.\\n•\\nChills or dizziness.\\nSymptoms of severe COVID-19 disease include:\\n•\\nShortness of breath.\\n•\\nLoss of appetite.\\n•\\nConfusion.\\n•\\nPersistent pain or pressure in the chest.\\n•\\nHigh temperature (above 38 °C).\\nOther less common symptoms are\\n•\\nIrritability.\\n•\\nConfusion.\\n•\\nReduced consciousness (sometimes associated with\\nseizures).\\n•\\nAnxiety.\\n•\\nDepression.\\n•\\nSleep disorders.\\n•\\nMore severe and rare neurological complications such\\nas strokes, brain inflammation, delirium and nerve\\ndamage.\\nPeople of all ages who experience fever and/or cough\\nassociated with difficulty breathing or shortness of\\nbreath, chest pain or pressure, or loss of speech or\\nmovement should seek medical care immediately. If\\npossible, call your health care provider, hotline or health\\nfacility first, so you can be directed to the right clinic [1].\\nEPIDEMIOLOGY\\nAll ages are at risk of getting the illness. This is because\\nthe ailment is transmitted through large droplets that\\nresult from coughing and sneezing by symptomatic\\nindividuals. In some instances, the infection can happen\\nfrom asymptomatic individuals and before the beginning\\nof symptoms. As of March 2020, the WHO announced\\nthat there are about 87,317 cases of COVID- 19 globally\\nas well as confirmed cases of deaths is 2,977. This implies\\nthat the disease symptoms are mild as only 3.42 per cent\\nof patients with it have died because of the virus. At the\\nsame time, the high number of incidences and deaths\\nhave been identified in China. It is that 92 per cent of the\\ntotal number of occurrences have been reported in Asia,\\nmainly China. Importantly, the confirmed incidences are\\nclinically identified and laboratory-confirmed. Further,\\noutside Asia, the number of cases and deaths differs due\\nto the on-going nature of the disease, population density,\\ndegree of testing and reporting, and timing of reducing\\nstrategies. The features of COVID-19 are categorized into\\nthe host of the virus, transmission mode and incubation\\nperiod. In the first place, the Chinese horseshoe bat is the\\nnatural hosts and the terminal hosts are humans. Also,\\nthe transmission is from individual to individual through\\naerosol droplets. Lastly, the incubation period varies\\nfrom two to fourteen days. Therefore, COVID-19\\ncumulative incidence differs depending on the country\\nand incidences have been confirmed in almost all\\ncontinents [7].\\nGEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION\\nSince the initial report from China, the disease spread\\nrapidly, and the number of cases increased exponentially.\\nOn January 11, the first case was reported outside\\nmainland China in Thailand,7 and within months, the\\ndisease spread to all the continents except Antarctica.\\nFathima Hinaz Z, et al.\\nJournal of Research in Medical and Dental Science | Vol. 9 | Issue 10 | October-2021\\n282\\nJ Res Med Dent Sci, 2021, 9 (10):281-288'),\n",

This rose to three cases by February 3, 2020. No\\nfurther cases were reported in February 2020. However,\\nby mid-March, the number of infected cases started to\\nincrease, and many cases were reported from all over\\nIndia. The first COVID-19 related death in India was\\nreported on March 12, 2020. By the second week of April,\\nthe disease spread to all states in India except Sikkim. At\\nthe time of writing this manuscript, there have been\\n2,170,265 cases and 135,163 deaths globally and 15,712\\ncases and 507 deaths in India [8,9].\\nTRANSMISSION\\nZoonotic transmission initially appeared to be a plausible\\ncause as majority of early cases had a history of exposure\\nto wet markets [10]. However, by the end of January\\n2020, the number of people who developed the disease\\nwithout exposure to the market or another person with\\nrespiratory symptoms increased. The spread of the\\ndisease among persons who did not visit Wuhan and\\namong healthcare workers suggested a person-to-person\\nspread of the virus [11,12]. The exact mode of\\ntransmission of this virus is unknown. But, as with other\\nrespiratory viruses, droplet borne infection, either\\ndirectly or indirectly, through fomites is probably the\\npredominant mode of transmission. At present, there is\\nno evidence for airborne transmission of the virus.12 13\\nAlthough virus particles have been detected in stool\\nsamples of both symptomatic and convalescing patients,\\nthe risk of feco-oral transmission is unclear [13].\\nPeriod of Infectivity\\nThe duration for which a patient with COVID-19 remains\\ninfective is unclear. Viral load in the oropharyngeal\\nsecretions is highest during the early symptomatic stage\\nof the disease [13,14]. The patient can continue to shed\\nthe virus even after symptom resolution [13]. In a study\\nfrom China, the median duration of virus shedding was\\n20 days (interquartile range [IQR] 17.0–24.0) amongst\\nthe survivors [15]. A study of viral dynamics in mild and\\nsevere cases revealed that mild cases tend to clear the\\nviruses early, while severe cases can have prolonged viral\\nshedding [16]. Data from studies using twin respiratory\\nand fecal sampling have shown viral shedding can persist\\nin stools for more than 4 weeks even when respiratory\\nsamples are negative [17]. Xu et al identified male sex,\\ndelayed hospitalization after illness, and invasive\\nmechanical ventilation as risk factors for prolonged viral\\nshedding [13]. Transmission during the asymptomatic\\nphase has also been reported. In a study from Singapore,\\n6.4% of the 157 locally acquired cases of COVID-19 were\\nattributed to transmission during the asymptomatic\\nphase of the disease [18].\\nCLINICAL FEATURES\\nThe clinical features of this ailment vary, extending from\\nan asymptomatic state to acute respiratory distress\\nsyndrome to septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction.\\nIdeally, this ailment is categorized depending on its\\nseverity and this include mild, moderate, severe, and\\ncritical. The shared symptoms of individuals with the\\ndisease include fever (98.6 per cent), tiredness (69.6 per\\ncent), dry cough, and looseness of the bowels.\\nAsymptomatic infections\\nAsymptomatic infections have been well documented\\n[19-27]. One review estimated that 33 percent of people\\nwith SARS-CoV-2 infection never develop symptoms [28].\\nThis estimate was based on four large population-based,\\ncross-sectional surveys, among which the median\\nproportion of individuals who had no symptoms at the\\ntime of a positive test was 46 percent (range 43 to 77\\npercent), and on 14 longitudinal studies, among which a\\nmedian of 73 percent of initially asymptomatic\\nindividuals remained so on follow-up. However, there is\\nstill uncertainty around the proportion of asymptomatic\\ninfections, with a wide range reported across studies.\\nAdditionally, the definition of \"asymptomatic\" may vary\\nacross studies, depending on which specific symptoms\\nwere assessed. The range of findings in studies\\nevaluating asymptomatic infections is reflected in the\\nfollowing examples:\\n•\\nIn a COVID-19 outbreak on a cruise ship where nearly\\nall passengers and staff were screened for severe\\nacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-\\nCoV-2), approximately 19 percent of the population\\non board tested positive; 58 percent of the 712\\nconfirmed COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic at the\\ntime of diagnosis [29,30]. In studies of subsets of\\nthose \\nasymptomatic \\nindividuals, \\nwho \\nwere\\nhospitalized and monitored, approximately 77 to 89\\npercent remained asymptomatic over time [30,31].\\n•\\nIn a smaller COVID-19 outbreak within a skilled\\nnursing facility, 27 of the 48 residents (56 percent)\\nwho had a positive screening test were asymptomatic\\nat the time of diagnosis, but 24 of them developed\\nsymptoms over the next seven days [32].\\n•\\nOther studies, particularly those conducted among\\nyounger populations, have reported even higher\\nproportions of infections that are asymptomatic\\n[33-37]. As an example, in an outbreak on an aircraft\\ncarrier, a quarter of the crew, among whom the mean\\nage was 27 years, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 [36].\\nAmong the 1271 cases, only 22 percent were\\nsymptomatic at the time of testing and 43 percent\\nremained asymptomatic throughout the observation\\nperiod. High rates of asymptomatic infection have\\nalso \\nbeen \\nreported \\namong \\npregnant \\nwomen\\npresenting for delivery [2,34].\\nPatients with asymptomatic infection may have objective\\nclinical abnormalities [24,38]. As an example, in a study\\nof 24 patients with asymptomatic infection who all\\nunderwent chest computed tomography (CT), 50 percent\\nhad typical ground-glass opacities or patchy shadowing,\\nand \\nanother \\n20 \\npercent \\nhad \\natypical \\nimaging\\nabnormalities [38]. Five patients developed low-grade\\nfever, with or without other typical symptoms, a few days\\nafter diagnosis.

In one study, symptom\\nonset occurred a median of four days (range of three to\\nseven) after the initial positive RT-PCR test [30].\\nSEVERITY OF SYMPTOMATIC INFECTION\\nSpectrum of infection severity\\nThe spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild\\nto critical; most infections are not severe [19,39-44].\\nSpecifically, in a report from the Chinese Centre for\\nDisease \\nControl \\nand \\nPrevention \\nthat \\nincluded\\napproximately 44,500 confirmed infections with an\\nestimation of disease severity [45]:\\n•\\nMild disease (no or mild pneumonia) was reported in\\n81 percent.\\n•\\nSevere disease (eg, with dyspnea, hypoxia, or >50\\npercent lung involvement on imaging within 24 to 48\\nhours) was reported in 14 percent.\\n•\\nCritical disease (eg, with respiratory failure, shock, or\\nmultiorgan dysfunction) was reported in 5 percent.\\n•\\nThe overall case fatality rate was 2.3 percent; no\\ndeaths were reported among noncritical cases.\\nSimilarly, in a report of 1.3 million cases reported to the\\nUnited States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\n(CDC) through the end of May 2020, 14 percent were\\nhospitalized, 2 percent were admitted to the intensive\\ncare unit (ICU), and 5 percent died [46]. The risk of\\nsevere \\nillness \\nvaried \\nby \\nage \\nand \\nunderlying\\ncomorbidities.\\nInfection fatality rates\\nThe case fatality rate only indicates the mortality rate\\namong documented cases. Since many severe acute\\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)\\ninfections are asymptomatic and many mild infections do\\nnot get diagnosed, the infection fatality rate (i.e., the\\nestimated mortality rate among all individuals with\\ninfection) is considerably lower and has been estimated\\nin some analyses to be between 0.15 and 1 percent, with\\nsubstantial heterogeneity by location and across risk\\ngroups [47-50].\\nFatality rates among hospitalized patients\\nAmong hospitalized patients, the risk of critical or fatal\\ndisease is high [51-57]. In a study from early in the\\npandemic that included 2741 patients who were\\nhospitalized for COVID-19 in a New York City health care\\nsystem, 665 patients (24 percent) died or were\\ndischarged to hospice [54]. Of the 647 patients who\\nreceived invasive mechanical ventilation, 60 percent died,\\n13 percent were still ventilated, and 16 percent were\\ndischarged by the end of the study. The in-hospital\\nfatality rate associated with COVID-19 has been higher\\nthan that for influenza [58-60]. As an example, in an\\nanalysis of hospital data from the United States Veterans\\nHealth Administration, patients with COVID-19 were five\\ntimes more likely to die during the hospitalization than\\npatients with influenza (21 versus 3.8 percent) [44].\\nOver the course of the pandemic, declining in-hospital\\nfatality rates have been reported [61-64]. As an example,\\nin a retrospective study of a national surveillance\\ndatabase in England that included over 21,000 critical\\ncare patients with COVID-19, ICU survival improved from\\n58 percent in late March 2020 to 80 percent by June\\n2020 [61]. The reasons for this observation are\\nuncertain, \\nbut \\npotential \\nexplanations \\ninclude\\nimprovements in hospital care of COVID-19 and better\\nallocation of resources when hospitals were not\\noverburdened.\\nIn resource-limited settings, in-hospital mortality rates\\nmay be higher than those reported elsewhere. As an\\nexample, in a study from 10 countries in Africa, where\\nthere was a median of two intensive care specialists in\\neach hospital and a minority of facilities did not have\\npulse oximetry, the in-hospital 30-day mortality rate\\nfollowing critical care admission was 48 percent [65].\\nMortality was associated with underlying comorbidities\\nas well as resource shortages.\\nExcess deaths during the pandemic\\nNeither the case fatality rate nor the infection fatality rate\\naccount for the full burden of the pandemic, which\\nincludes excess mortality from other conditions because\\nof delayed care, overburdened health care systems, and\\nsocial determinants of health [66-68].\\nIncubation period and serial interval\\nThe mean or median incubation period of the disease\\nranges from 5 to 6 days [69,70]. Lauer et al estimated\\nthat 2.5% of the patients will develop symptoms within\\n2.2 days (95% CI, 1.8 to 2.9 days) and 97.5% of patients\\nwill develop symptoms within 11.5 days (95% CI, 8.2–\\n15.6 days).\\nSerial interval refers to the time interval between the\\nonset of symptoms in the primary case and the\\nsecondary case. The mean serial interval is estimated to\\nbe approximately 4 to 5 days [71,72]. By analysing data\\nfrom 468 infector–infectee pairs, Du et al noted that 59\\nsecondary cases had symptoms earlier than their\\nprimary case. This suggested that there is a possibility\\nthat the transmission of the disease occurred during the\\nasymptomatic phase of illness in this group of patients\\n[73].\\nPeriod of Infectivity\\nThe duration for which a patient with COVID-19 remains\\ninfective is unclear.

The antigen test is often used as a point-\\nof-care test, less expensive and yields quicker results\\nwithin minutes. However, there is a higher chance of\\nfalse-negative results as compared to molecular testing.\\nMolecular testing yields more accurate results but are\\ntime-consuming [79].\\nTREATMENT\\nInitially, early in the pandemic, the understanding of\\nCOVID-19 and its therapeutic management was limited,\\ncreating an urgency to mitigate this new viral illness with\\nexperimental therapies and drug repurposing. Since then,\\ndue to the intense efforts of clinical researchers globally,\\nsignificant progress has been made which has led to a\\nbetter understanding of not only COVID-19 and its\\nmanagement but also has resulted in the development of\\nnovel therapeutics and vaccine development at an\\nunprecedented speed [80].\\nPREVENTION\\nPreventive measures are the current strategy to limit the\\nspread of cases. Early screening, diagnosis, isolation, and\\ntreatment are necessary to prevent further spread.\\nPreventive strategies are focused on the isolation of\\npatients \\nand \\ncareful \\ninfection \\ncontrol, \\nincluding\\nappropriate measures to be adopted during the diagnosis\\nand the provision of clinical care to an infected patient\\n[81]. Important COVID-19 prevention and control\\nmeasures in community are summarized in Table 1.\\nTable 1: COVID-19 prevention and control measures\\nin community.\\nQuarantine\\nOther Measures\\nVoluntary quarantine (self-quarantine)\\nAvoiding crowding\\nMandatory quarantine\\nHand hygiene\\nPrivate residence\\nIsolation\\nHospital\\nPersonal protective equipment\\nPublic institution\\nSchool measures/closures\\nOthers (cruise ships, etc)\\nSocial distancing\\nWorkplace measures/closures\\nCONCLUSION\\nAs everyone across the globe is aware that there is no\\naccurate medicine for Covid-19 till date, hence it is very\\nimportant to prevent the spread in the society. Notably,\\nCOVID-19 is an RNA virus that poses a threat to public\\nhealth. Currently, the disease has caused thousands of\\ninfections and deaths. The main points in preventing the\\nspread in society are hand hygiene, social distancing and\\nquarantine.\\nREFERENCES\\n1.\\nAlmutairi MA.
